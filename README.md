@0xtr4zn here,

I'll keep it brief. 

I have managed to almost fully complete my education at ASU as a computer scientist (focusing on cyber security) without making a github account. My projects,
as of late, have recently experienced an uptick not only in scale, but difficulty. The time felt right to come here and start acting like a real hax0r. Contained
within the annals of this page will be my most important and involved projects, for you to see, download, and ruin. It is with great excitement that I present to
you my repositories.
